This is code for a timer that tells you to take a break every 2 hours you are working. 

This code was created for the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree. As such I do not clam ownership over the code prsented. I also do not clam owner ship if the muisc presented in the URL. All rights belong to their respectful owners.

How to use:

Step One: Copy and paste code in working Python shell.

Step Three: When the song "Take a Break" plays, take a brake for the duration of the song.
Step Four: Go back to work after the song is over.
Step Five: Repeat steps Three and Four 2 more times. After which, the program ends and you have to start it again or stop working.

Code can be modified for personal prefernce.
